# Burgflow Archive

This folder contains materials from the previous product phase.

## Why this exists

- The product was renamed and continued as **Pixflow**.
- Legacy docs, old package structure, and historical backups were moved here to keep the root workspace clean.

## Active project locations (Pixflow)

- `/Users/pixery/Projects/pixflow/src` - active app code
- `/Users/pixery/Projects/pixflow/docs` - active documentation
- `/Users/pixery/Projects/pixflow/CLAUDE.md` - active project intelligence

## Archive policy

- Do not place new Pixflow development files in this folder.
- Use this folder only for historical reference or migration support.
