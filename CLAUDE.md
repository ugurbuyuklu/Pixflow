> Primary reference for the active Pixflow desktop app.

## Project

Pixflow is an Electron desktop app for AI asset production workflows:
- Prompt Factory (concept/image to structured prompts)
- Asset Monster (batch image generation)
- Avatar Studio (avatar, script, TTS, lipsync)
- The Machine (end-to-end pipeline orchestration)
- Library (history, favorites, reuse)

## Active code paths

- `src/main` - Electron main process
- `src/preload` - Electron bridge
- `src/renderer` - UI application
- `src/server` - embedded Express API
- `docs` - active documentation

## Notes

- Legacy materials were moved to `Burgflow Archive/`.
- Keep Pixflow naming in all new docs, routes, and UX copy.
