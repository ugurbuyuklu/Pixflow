## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Copying technical styles between concepts

```
Valentine used fish-eye → Don't auto-apply to Halloween
Christmas has warm tones → Don't auto-apply to Summer
```

### ❌ Mentioning identity

```
"Beautiful blonde woman" → WRONG
"Warm genuine smile" → CORRECT
```

### ❌ Forgetting CRITICAL tags

```
If the red fur backdrop is essential, tag it CRITICAL
Otherwise model might substitute something "realistic"
```

### ❌ All prompts looking the same

```
If all 8 prompts have same lighting + pose + aesthetic = FAIL
Must have variety across axes
```
